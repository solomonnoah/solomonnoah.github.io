We analyze a family of graphs known as banana graphs, constructing new examples of finite graphs which are Brill-Noether general. These are the first such examples since the analysis of chains of loops by Cools, Draisma, Payne and Robeva. Our primary technique is a combinatorial tool called a transmission permutation.
