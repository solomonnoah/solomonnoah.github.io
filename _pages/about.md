I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech interested in a wide variety of topics connected to algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory. In particular I care about things like chip-firing on graphs, tropical methods, toric varieties, quivers, and combinatorial group theory.  I believe that math can and should be for everyone.

I'm passionate about sharing math with the world and firmly believe in Frederica Ardilla's [four axioms](http://fardila.com/):

Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. 



I graduated from with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Amherst College in 2022 after which I worked in the Moss Quantitave Center at the college, providing tutoring and TA support for a wide variety of classes.

Outside of the world of math, I love to run, climb, ride bikes and generally be outdoors. I also enjoy drinking pu'er, playing the odd game of chess, and mending things, often clothes.
