I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech working with [Matt Baker](https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home/) interested in problems related to algebra and combinatorics, especially matroids. Recently, my work has been focused on realizations of matroids over more general algebraic objects, including valuated and oriented matroids.  I believe that math can and should be for everyone.

I'm passionate about sharing math with the world and firmly believe in Frederica Ardilla's [four axioms](http://fardila.com/):

* Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

* Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

* Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

* Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. 



I graduated from Amherst College with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics in 2022 after which I worked in the Moss Quantitave Center at the college, providing tutoring and TA support for a wide variety of classes.

Outside of the world of math, I love to ride bikes, run and generally be outdoors. I also enjoy mending clothes, making and solving crosswords, and watching professional cycling.
