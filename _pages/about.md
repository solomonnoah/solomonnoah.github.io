I'm an aspiring mathematician interested in a wide variety of topics connected to algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory. I'm passionate about sharing math with the world and believe in Frederica Ardilla's [four axioms](http://fardila.com/):

Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. 



I graduated from Amherst College in 2022 and I currently work at the Moss Quantitative Center providing one-on-one and group tutoring for a range of classes.
